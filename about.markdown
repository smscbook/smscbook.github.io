### **Massimo D'Elia** {#Massimo} 
[Massimo Dâ€™Elia](https://www.df.unipi.it/en/people/delia-massimo) is Professor of Theoretical Physics at the Physics Department of the University of Pisa. Alumnus of the Scuola Normale Superiore in Pisa, he got his PhD in Physics from Pisa University in 1998. He has been Postdoctoral Fellow at the University of Cyprus and at ETH, Zurich, and Assistant Professor at the Physics Department of the University of Genoa. He is an expert in Lattice Gauge Theories and their implementation on HPC infrastructures, with interests also in Quantum Computing and numerical approaches to Quantum Gravity. He has obtained various achievements, especially in the study of the Phase Diagram of strong interactions. He has served as a reviewer for major scientific journals and funding agencies. He is author of two textbooks and more than 200 papers.

### **Kurt Langfeld** {#Kurt} 
[Kurt Langfeld](https://eps.leeds.ac.uk/maths/staff/8357/professor-kurt-langfeld) is Professor of Theoretical Physics and Head of School of Mathematics at the University of Leeds, England. His work in numerical methods for simulating Quantum Field Theories and Particle Physics is widely respected, with over 180 articles published in international journals. In 1991, he was awarded a PhD in Theoretical Physics from Technical University of Munich. He went on to serve as Researcher and Lecturer at the University of Tubingen, Germany from 1991 to 2006; during this time he also enjoyed research visits to CEA, Saclay (Paris) and KIAS (Seoul). In 1999, he achieved the highly esteemed Venia Legendi award at the University of Tubingen. 2005 saw him become Professor for Theoretical Physics at the University of Tubingen, before moving on to Plymouth Univeristy as part of their Particle Physics group in 2006. April 2012 saw him assume full Professorship for Theoretical Physics at Plymouth and 2016 saw him become Professor and Head of Department of Mathematical Sciences at the University of Liverpool. In 2020, he took up his current role as Head of School of Mathematics at the University of Leeds. He has dedicated himself to giving back to the community; he has been an active reviewer for the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC), Austrian council FWF, Swiss National Supercomputer Center (CSCS). He is a member of the Parliament Scientific Committee, devoted trustee of the University of Liverpool Maths School (ULMaS) and part of the Steering Group opening an University sponsored Mathematics specialist 6th form in Leeds.

### **Biagio Lucini** {#Biagio}    
[Biagio Lucini](https://www.swansea.ac.uk/staff/b.lucini/) is a Fellow of the [Learned Society of Wales](https://www.learnedsociety.wales), Professor of [Mathematics](https://www.swansea.ac.uk/maths/) and the Director of the [Swansea Academy of Advanced Computing](https://www.swansea.ac.uk/compsci/swansea-academy-of-advanced-computing-sa2c/) at [Swansea University](https://www.swansea.ac.uk). He was awarded a Ph.D. in Theoretical Particle Physics by Scuola Normale (Pisa, Italy) in 2000. Before joining Swansea University in 2005, he was a Postdoctoral Fellow at the Rudolf Peierls Centre for Theoretical Physics (Oxford University, UK) from 2000 to 2003 and at the Theoretical Physics Institute of ETH (Zurich, Switzerland) from 2003 to 2005. His research interests include Lattice Field Theory, Statistical Mechanics, Machine Learning, High-Performance Computing and Modelling of Infectious Diseases. An updated list of his research publications is available from [Inspire](https://inspirehep.net/authors/1032622?ui-citation-summary=true) or from [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=B8oZzXAAAAAJ&hl=en&inst=15992813652391199708). Biagio has been the recipient of the Royal Society University Research Fellowship, the Royal Society Wolfson Merit Award and the Leverhulme Fellowship. During the COVID-19 pandemic he has co-led a team of multidisciplinary researchers and research software engineers providing disease spread scenarios that has informed the non-pharmaceutical intervention policies of Welsh Government. His research projects include [Supercomputing Wales](https://www.supercomputing.wales/) and [ExaTEPP](https://www.hartree.stfc.ac.uk/work-with-us/projects/exatepp/). He is currently serving as a member of the Technical Directorate of the Science and Technology Facilities (STFC) Research Council High-Performance Computing [DiRAC](https://dirac.ac.uk/) and as a chair of the Particle Physics Theory sub-panel of the STFC [Ernest Rutherford Fellowship](https://www.ukri.org/what-we-do/developing-people-and-skills/stfc/fellowships/ernest-rutherford-fellowships/). In his free time he can often been found cycling around the [Gower peninsula](https://www.visitwales.com/destinations/west-wales/swansea-bay/exploring-gower-peninsula).
